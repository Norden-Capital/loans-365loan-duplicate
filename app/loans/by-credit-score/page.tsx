            How Credit Score Bands Work in Canada
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Canadian credit bureaus like Equifax generally classify scores as Poor (300-559), Fair (560-659), Good (660-724), Very Good (725-759), and Excellent (760-900). Where you fall changes which lenders will consider your application and what APR they'll offer — but it's rarely the only factor. Income, employment stability, and existing debt all play a role too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[0.9rem] text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Some of the ranges below overlap on purpose, since our lender network segments risk slightly differently than the standard bureau bands. If your score is near a boundary, check the neighbouring range as well — the difference of a few points can change your options more than you'd expect.
